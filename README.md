# Pointer

Kyle Prikopa

COP 2224-C++ Programming

Usage
-----

There is no user input for this program.
Create a char pointer. Initialize the pointer to point to "John Doe".
Print the name using the pointer.
Print the string in reverse order. That is print the last letter first, the second to the last letter next, and so on. You must use the char pointer for everything. You cannot use an index (subscript) anywhere in your program. That means you cannot have any [ ] in your program (no square brackets). Your code must work for any string not just "John Doe". Meaning if I change only your string from step 2 to "Samuel Smith", with no other modifications, your code should be able to print Samuel Smith backwards.

Output
------
John Doe
